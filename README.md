# Emotion Recognition
## _Image Classification using CNN's_

For a final project in a course on deep learning, I train convolutional neural networks to classify the emotions depicted in frontal face images. In this sample of 11,000+ images, each was be labelled as depicting either anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, or sadness.

[Please find my analysis and modelling here](Emotion_Recognition.ipynb), which I performed in Google Colab.
